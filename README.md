# Dog Log

Dog Log is a simple node journaling app to keep track of incoming foster dogs because the turnover from foster to adopted out can make it hard to remember them.

Using just the command line, I can enter a dog's name, color, sex, and basic personality description. I can also delete a dog from the list and retrieve all or one.
